<p>This game is about chasing a pesky asteroid around your space datacenter.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ul>
<li>You start out with just your servers <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ECRHRbD.png"> (not interactive) and the asteroid <img src="http://i.imgur.com/fZoOANW.png"> (stationary).</li>
<li>Click near the asteroid to start the chase. The asteroid will begin to move.</li>
<li>The asteroid will light up <img src="http://i.imgur.com/AQAuW0e.png"> every few seconds.</li>
<li>Click the asteroid when it is lit up, which gives you <strong>3 points</strong>. Obviously you'll have to chase it around.</li>
<li>Note: if the asteroid is behind a server and you click the server, it still counts.</li>
<li>If you accidentally click the asteroid when it is not lit, you <strong>lose 1 point</strong>.</li>
<li>Try to maximize your score in 3 minutes.</li>
<li>After 3 minutes, you will be redirected to a page containing a randomly generated password. Submit this password to complete the HIT on Mechanical Turk.</li>
</ul>
